            <h2>What is SDG 14?</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14), "Life Below Water," aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. Oceans are essential for the survival of life on Earth, providing food, oxygen, and regulating the climate. This goal seeks to protect marine ecosystems, reduce pollution, and promote the sustainable management of marine resources.</p>

            <h2>Why is it importantï¼Ÿ</h2>
            <p>The oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface and are vital for supporting life on Earth. They regulate weather patterns, provide food sources, and support biodiversity. However, they are facing significant threats that jeopardize the health of marine life and the benefits we derive from them. SDG 14 focuses on safeguarding these ecosystems for future generations.</p>

            <h2>Current Threats to Oceans and Marine Life</h2>
            <li><strong>Overfishing: Unsustainable fishing practices are depleting fish populations and disrupting marine food chains.</li>
            <li><strong>Pollution: Oceans are becoming increasingly polluted with plastics, chemicals, and untreated sewage, harming marine life and ecosystems.</li>
           
            
<!--             <p>Oceans cover 70% of Earth's surface and provide over half of the oxygen we breathe. They are home to diverse marine life but are under threat from pollution, overfishing, and climate change.</p> -->
