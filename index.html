            <h2>Why is it important？</h2>
            <p>Healthy oceans and seas are crucial for human survival. We depend on them for food, energy, and water, and they make up 70% of our world. But humans have caused significant damage to these valuable resources. We must protect them by eliminating pollution and overfishing　to responsibly manage and protect all marine life around the world.</p>

            <p>Oceans cover 70% of Earth's surface and provide over half of the oxygen we breathe. They are home to diverse marine life but are under threat from pollution, overfishing, and climate change.</p>
